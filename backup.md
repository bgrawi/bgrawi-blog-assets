#About

Hi. I'm a Software Engineering student at the Rochester Institute of Technonology, and I love creating the web. But first, lets back up a little. My father first showed me HTML when I was in 4th grade. Since then I taught myself eveything I needed to know about web developement. I started by doing small freelancing work, which proved to be quite profitable (hey, 200 dollars for a 7th grader was pretty awesome!) and really inspired me to learn. After teaching myself php, databases, JavaScript and the whole rest of the stack, I made many more WordPress sites than I'd like to admit, but that all changed when I got hired by [The Green Team](http://greenteamhv.com) when I finally learned that I loved to create full applications, rather than just basic freelance sites. I enjoyed my experience there so much that I decided to study Software Engineering at RIT. And here I am, a Web Application Developer with over 9 years experience who is only a freshman in college.

#Projects

I have worked on countless numbers of projects since I was 10, but here is a selection of some of my more recent work.

I was hired by The Green Team Home Selling System, a real estate brokerage, when I was just 15 years old. I would eventually be tasked with creating GreenTeamHV.com, a front-facing and backend solution for the company. Through this project, I learned a substantial ammount of programming, OO principals (yeah, I made my own MVC framework, complete with a custom ORM all in php), and a whole lot about frontend development as well.

##Commit Guru *(in development)*

In my freshman year at RIT, I was lucky enough to work with Assistant Professor Dr. Shihab of the Software Engineering department where me and another student worked to analyze software repositories, checking commits for riskyness. I made the entire  web front end with AngularJS on the front end and a new rails-like MVC framework for nodejs called [sails.js](http://sailsjs.org) which was really awesome to try out, especailly with socket.io communication baked in. Eventuatally we plan to use this data model to predict the riskyness of commits developers are about to commit, which will hopefully reduce bugs and improve the quality of software. It is still in development right now, but we hope to have a public beta sometime in the near future!

## [CSH ScheduleMaker](http://schedule-dev.csh.rit.edu) *(in beta)*

As a member of the Computer Science House at RIT, we are encouraged to take on varous projects that expand our knowlege. The [current CSH ScheduleMaker](http://schedule.csh.rit.edu) I felt was overdue for a redesign. I really wanted to learn some front-end JS frameworks, so a sat down and taught myself AngularJS, which I fell in love with. It was actually the first time I used Bootstrap on a serious project which turned out quite nicely. I made the schedules render in svg only using AngularJS templates which was really neat (and frustrating at times). My redesign will be released in a few weeks.
